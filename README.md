**Use symbols for simplicity**  
A : The multiplicand matrix  
B : The multiplier matrix  
C : The product matrix

### Transpose matrix
C stores matrix elements in row-major order, but we access B in col-major order. Therefore, we can transfer B into a transposed matrix, and 
### Parallelize process
### Strassen algorithm
